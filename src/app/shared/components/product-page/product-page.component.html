        <div class="product-info">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem
          Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy
          text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
          specimen book. It has survived not only five
          centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
          popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
          sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
          PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
